This mod adds Sorting Chests that can be configured through various filters and form a sorting network.

Special Thanks to Dynious, original creator of Refined Relocation, who has given me permission to continue the project.

## Features

- Sorting Chests that automatically combine into a sorting network, based on configurable filters
- Preset Filter with common things like "All Ingots", "All Ores", etc.
- Name Filter with wildcard support
- Item Match Filter that lets items through that already exist in an inventory
- Mod Match Filter that lets items through if an item of its mod already exists inside
- Creative Tab Filter and Mod Filter - self explanatory.
- Iron Chests Compatibility (Sorting Iron Chests)
- Sorting Interface to connect inventories from other mods into the sorting network
- Block Extender to expand a block's I/O faces
- Fast and Filtered Hopper for simple item transport
